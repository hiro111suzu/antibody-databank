During development plays a role in blood and lymphatic vessels separation by binding CLEC1B, triggering CLEC1B activation in platelets and leading to platelet activation and/or aggregation. Interaction with CD9, on the contrary, attenuates platelet aggregation and pulmonary metastasis induced by PDPN. Mediates effects on cell migration and adhesion through its different partners. Through MSN or EZR interaction promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) leading to ERZ phosphorylation and triggering RHOA activation leading to cell migration increase and invasiveness. Interaction with CD44 promotes directional cell migration in epithelial and tumor cells (By similarity). In lymph nodes (LNs), controls fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and contraction of the actomyosin by maintaining ERM proteins (EZR; MSN and RDX) and MYL9 activation through association with unknown transmembrane proteins. Engagement of CLEC1B by PDPN promotes FRCs relaxation by blocking lateral membrane interactions leading to reduction of ERM proteins (EZR; MSN and RDX) and MYL9 activation (By similarity). Through binding with LGALS8 may participate to connection of the lymphatic endothelium to the surrounding extracellular matrix. In keratinocytes, induces changes in cell morphology showing an elongated shape, numerous membrane protrusions, major reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, increased motility and decreased cell adhesion. Controls invadopodia stability and maturation leading to efficient degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumor cells through modulation of RHOC activity in order to activate ROCK1/ROCK2 and LIMK1/LIMK2 and inactivation of CFL1 (By similarity). Required for normal lung cell proliferation and alveolus formation at birth (By similarity). Does not function as a water channel or as a regulator of aquaporin-type water channels (By similarity). Does not have any effect on folic acid or amino acid transport (By similarity).",["1","2"]]],"subunit":[["Homodimer. Interacts with CLEC1B; the interaction is independent of CLEC1B glycosylation and activates CLEC1B; the interaction is dependent of sialic acid on O-glycans. Interacts with CD9; this interaction is homophilic and attenuates platelet aggregation and pulmonary metastasis induced by PDPN. Interacts with LGALS8; the interaction is glycosylation-dependent; may participate to connection of the lymphatic endothelium to the surrounding extracellular matrix. Interacts with HSPA9. Interacts (via extracellular domain) with CD44; this interaction is required for PDPN-mediated directional migration and regulation of lamellipodia extension/stabilization during cell spreading and migration. Interacts (via cytoplasmic domain) with MSN and EZR; activates RHOA and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Interacts with CCL21; relocalized PDPN to the basolateral membrane.",["2"]]],"tissue specificity":[["In adult kidney, expressed on the urinary surface and foot processes of podocytes and in parietal epithelial cells of Bowman's capsule where it is localized to luminal surfaces.
