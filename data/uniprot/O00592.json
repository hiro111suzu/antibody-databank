Function as an anti-adhesive molecule that maintains an open filtration pathway between neighboring foot processes in the podocyte by charge repulsion. Acts as a pro-adhesive molecule, enhancing the adherence of cells to immobilized ligands, increasing the rate of migration and cell-cell contacts in an integrin-dependent manner. Induces the formation of apical actin-dependent microvilli. Involved in the formation of a preapical plasma membrane subdomain to set up initial epithelial polarization and the apical lumen formation during renal tubulogenesis. Plays a role in cancer development and aggressiveness by inducing cell migration and invasion through its interaction with the actin-binding protein EZR. Affects EZR-dependent signaling events, leading to increased activities of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in cancer cells.",["6","7"]]],"subunit":[["Monomer; when associated with the membrane raft. Oligomer; when integrated in the apical membrane. Interacts (via the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif DTHL) with SLC9A3R1 (via the PDZ domains); the interaction is not detected in glomerular epithelium cells, take place early in the secretory pathway and is necessary for its apical membrane sorting. Found in a complex with EZR, PODXL and SLC9A3R2. Associates with the actin cytoskeleton through complex formation with EZR and SLC9A3R2. Interacts (via the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif DTHL) with SLC9A3R2 (via the PDZ 1 domain); interaction is detected in glomerular epithelium cells (By similarity).
