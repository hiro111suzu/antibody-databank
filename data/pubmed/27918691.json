We recently demonstrated that anticanine PDPN monoclonal antibody (mAb), PMab-38, recognizes canine PDPN of squamous cell carcinomas, but does not react with lymphatic endothelial cells. Herein, we investigated whether PMab-38 reacts with canine melanoma. PMab-38 reacted with 90% of melanoma cells (9/10 cases) using immunohistochemistry. Of interest, PMab-38 stained the lymphatic endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in melanoma tissues, although it did not stain any lymphatic endothelial cells in normal tissues. PMab-38 could be useful for uncovering the function of PDPN in canine melanomas."],"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"chemistry"},{"name":"Antibody Specificity"},{"name":"Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Dog Diseases","q":"diagnosis"},{"name":"Dogs"},{"name":"Endothelial Cells","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Gene Expression"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Melanoma","q":"diagnosis"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"analysis"},{"name":"Mouth Neoplasms","q":"diagnosis"}]}
