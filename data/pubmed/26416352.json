PDPN is associated with malignant progression, tumor metastasis, and poor prognosis in several types of cancer. Although many anti-human PDPN (hPDPN) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as D2-40 and NZ-1, have been established, these epitopes are limited to the platelet aggregation-stimulating (PLAG) domain (amino acids 29-54) of hPDPN. Recently, we developed a novel mouse anti-hPDPN mAb, LpMab-7, which is more sensitive than D2-40 and NZ-1, using the Cancer-specific mAb (CasMab) method. The epitope of LpMab-7 was shown to be entirely different from that of NZ-1, a neutralizing mAb against the PLAG domain according to an inhibition assay and lectin microarray analysis. In the present study, we produced a mouse-human chimeric anti-hPDPN mAb, chLpMab-7. ChLpMab-7 showed high antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Furthermore, chLpMab-7 inhibited the growth of hPDPN-expressing tumors in vivo. Although chLpMab-7 recognizes a non-PLAG domain of hPDPN, it suppressed the hematogenous metastasis of hPDPN-expressing tumors. These results indicated that chLpMab-7 suppressed tumor development and hematogenous metastasis in a neutralization-independent manner. In conclusion, hPDPN shows promise as a target in the development of a novel antibody-based therapy."],"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"CHO Cells"},{"name":"Cell Line, Tumor"},{"name":"Cricetinae"},{"name":"Cricetulus"},{"name":"Epitopes","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Female"},{"name":"HEK293 Cells"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Lung Neoplasms","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Mice"},{"name":"Mice, Inbred BALB C"},{"name":"Mice, Nude"},{"name":"Neoplasm Metastasis"},{"name":"PDPN protein, human"},{"name":"Transfection"}]}
