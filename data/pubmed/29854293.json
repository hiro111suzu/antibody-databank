We recently produced the novel anti-PODXL monoclonal antibody (mAb) PcMab-47 (IgG, kappa). Herein, we engineered PcMab-47 into 47-mG, a mouse IgG-type mAb, to add antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We further developed 47-mG-f, a core fucose-deficient type of 47-mG to augment its ADCC. Immunohistochemical analysis of oral cancer tissues using PcMab-47 and 47-mG revealed that the latter stained oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells in a cytoplasmic pattern at a much lower concentration. PcMab-47 and 47-mG detected PODXL in 163/201 (81.1%) and in 197/201 (98.0%) OSCC samples, respectively. 47-mG-f also detected PODXL in OSCCs at a similar frequency as 47-mG.  analysis revealed that both 47-mG and 47-mG-f exhibited strong complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against CHO/hPODXL cells. In contrast, 47-mG-f exhibited much stronger ADCC than 47-mG against OSCC cells, indicating that ADCC and CDC of those anti-PODXL mAbs depend on target cells.  analysis revealed that both 47-mG and 47-mG-f exerted antitumor activity in CHO/hPODXL xenograft models at a dose of 100 \u03bcg or 500 \u03bcg/mouse/week administered twice. 47-mG-f, but not 47-mG, exerted antitumor activity in SAS and HSC-2 xenograft models at a dose of 100 \u03bcg/mouse/week administered three times. Although both 47-mG and 47-mG-f exerted antitumor activity in HSC-2 xenograft models at a dose of 500 \u03bcg/mouse/week administered twice, 47-mG-f also showed higher antitumor activity than 47-mG. These results suggested that a core fucose-deficient anti-PODXL mAb could be useful for antibody-based therapy against PODXL-expressing OSCCs."]}
