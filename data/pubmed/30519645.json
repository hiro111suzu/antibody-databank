PDPN overexpression in cancerous tissue is associated with hematogenous metastasis through interactions with the C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2). Previously, we have reported the development of a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), PMab-38 (IgG, kappa) against dog PDPN (dPDPN). PMab-38 was found to strongly react with canine squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and melanomas; however, it showed no reaction with lymphatic endothelial cells. Recently, we have developed and produced the mouse-canine mAb of subclass B, P38B that showed antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity against Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)/dPDPN cells. In the present study, we investigated the antitumor activity using mouse xenograft model. To induce ADCC activity by P38B, canine mononuclear cells were injected surrounding the tumors in a xenograft model. It was demonstrated that P38B exerted antitumor activity against the mouse xenograft model using CHO/dPDPN. These results suggest that P38B is useful for antibody therapy against dPDPN-expressing canine SCCs and melanomas."]}
