Recently, we established -PDPN mAbs against many species, such as human, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, bovine, pig, horse, goat, tiger, alpaca, and Tasmanian devil. However, anti-bear PDPN (bPDPN) has not been established yet. In this study, we immunized mice with bPDPN-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 (CHO/bPDPN) cells, and screened mAbs against bPDPN using flow cytometry. One of the mAbs, PMab-247 (IgG, kappa), specifically detected CHO/bPDPN cells by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Our findings suggest the potential usefulness of PMab-247 for the functional analyses of bPDPN."]}
