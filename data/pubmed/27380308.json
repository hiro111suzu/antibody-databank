PDPN activates platelet aggregation by binding to C-type lectin-like receptor-2 (CLEC-2) on platelets. Many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human PDPN, mouse PDPN, rat PDPN, rabbit PDPN, and bovine PDPN have been established; antidog PDPN (dPDPN) mAbs have not been developed. Herein, we immunized mice with the recombinant proteins of dPDPN and developed anti-dPDPN mAbs. One of the clones, PMab-38, is useful for detecting podocytes in immunohistochemical analysis; in contrast, it did not react with LECs or type I alveolar cells. PMab-38 also detected dPDPN specifically in flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. PMab-38 is expected to be useful for investigating the function of dPDPN, which is expressed in podocytes.
