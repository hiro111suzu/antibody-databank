Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, bovine, pig, and horse PDPN have been established in our previous studies. However, mAbs against alpaca PDPN (aPDPN), required for immunohistochemical analysis, remain to be developed. In the present study, we employed the Cell-Based Immunization and Screening (CBIS) method for producing -aPDPN mAbs. We immunized mice with aPDPN-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (CHO/aPDPN), and hybridomas producing mAbs against aPDPN were screened using flow cytometry. One of the mAbs, PMab-225 (IgG, kappa), specifically detected CHO/aPDPN cells via flow cytometry and recognized the aPDPN protein on Western blotting. Further, PMab-225 strongly stained lung type I alveolar cells, colon lymphatic endothelial cells, and kidney podocytes via immunohistochemistry. These findings demonstrate that PMab-225 antibody is useful to investigate the function of aPDPN via different techniques."]}
