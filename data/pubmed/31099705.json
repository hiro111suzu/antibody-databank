DGK\u03b1, 1 of the 10 DGK isozymes, is involved in T cell function. In the present study, we describe a specific monoclonal antibody DaMab-8 (mouse IgG, kappa) against DGK\u03b1, which is extremely useful for performing immunohistochemical analysis for T cells in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. Furthermore, we characterized the binding epitope of DaMab-8 using Western blotting and found that the sites Asn610, Leu611, Trp612, Gly613, Asp614, His619, Tyr623, and Gly624 of DGK\u03b1 are important for facilitating the DaMab-8 binding to the DGK\u03b1 protein. Thus, DaMab-8 could be advantageous for immunohistochemical analyses toward clarifying the distribution of DGK\u03b1-expressing T cells in every pathophysiological tissue."]}
