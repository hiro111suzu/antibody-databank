Regardless of the advances in lung cancer treatments, the prognosis is still poor. Podocalyxin (PODXL) is a highly glycosylated type I transmembrane protein that is expressed in normal tissues, including the heart, pancreas, and breast. It is also found and used as a diagnostic marker in many cancers, such as renal, brain, breast, oral, and lung cancers. We previously developed specific and sensitive anti-PODXL monoclonal antibodies, PcMab-47 (mouse IgG, kappa) and its mouse IgG-type (47-mG), both of which were suitable for immunohistochemical analyses of oral cancers. In this study, we investigated the utility of PcMab-47 and 47-mG for the immunohistochemical analyses of lung cancers. PcMab-47 stained 51/70 (72.9%) cases of lung cancer, whereas 47-mG stained 59/70 (84.3%) cases, indicating that the latter antibody is more sensitive and is useful for detecting PODXL in lung cancers."],"kw":[{"name":"Adenocarcinoma, Bronchiolo-Alveolar","q":"diagnosis"},{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"biosynthesis"},{"name":"Antibody Specificity"},{"name":"Biomarkers, Tumor","q":"genetics"},{"name":"CHO Cells"},{"name":"Carcinoma, Adenosquamous","q":"diagnosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma, Papillary","q":"diagnosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma, Small Cell","q":"diagnosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell","q":"diagnosis"},{"name":"Cricetulus"},{"name":"Gene Expression"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","q":"biosynthesis"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lung Neoplasms","q":"diagnosis"},{"name":"Mice"},{"name":"Recombinant Proteins","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Sialoglycoproteins","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Tissue Array Analysis"},{"name":"podocalyxin"}]}
