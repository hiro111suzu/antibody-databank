Since both DG and PA serve as lipidic second messengers, DGK plays a pivotal role in regulating the balance of two signaling pathways mediated by DG and PA in cellular functions. Reportedly, DGK\u03b3, one of the 10 mammalian DGK isozymes, is involved in leukemic cell differentiation, mast cell function, and membrane traffic. Transfection studies using tagged expression vectors and immunohistochemistry on rat tissues revealed that DGK\u03b3 localizes to the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and Golgi apparatus. However, a limited number of studies reported the detailed localization of native protein of DGK\u03b3 in human tissues and cells. In this study, we developed a novel anti-DGK\u03b3 monoclonal antibody, DgMab-6, which is very useful in immunocytochemistry of human cultured cells."],"kw":[{"name":"1,2-diacylglycerol"},{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Diacylglycerol Kinase","id":"2.7.1.107","db":"ec","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Diglycerides","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Isoenzymes","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Rats"},{"name":"Signal Transduction","q":"immunology"}]}
