Although we previously developed an anticanine podoplanin monoclonal antibody (mAb), PMab-38, immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that it did not react with canine lymphatic endothelial cells. Here, we determined whether PMab-38 recognizes canine podoplanin of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and clarified its epitope. In IHC, PMab-38 reacted with 83% of SCCs (15/18 cases). Flow cytometry showed that the epitope of PMab-38 was different from that of the platelet aggregation-stimulating domain of the N-terminus, which was detected by almost all antipodoplanin mAbs such as D2-40 or NZ-1. PMab-38 is expected to be useful for investigating the function of podoplanin in canine tumors."],"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"biosynthesis"},{"name":"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Dogs"},{"name":"Epitopes","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Flow Cytometry"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Membrane Proteins","q":"biosynthesis"},{"name":"Mouth Neoplasms","q":"genetics"},{"name":"T1A-2 protein, human"}]}
