Both DG and PA serve as lipidic second messengers; therefore, DGK plays a critical role in regulating the balance of two signaling pathways mediated by DG and PA in cellular functions. DGK gamma (DGK\u03b3), 1 of the 10 mammalian DGK isozymes, has been reported to be involved in membrane traffic, mast cell function, and leukemic cell differentiation. We previously developed a novel anti-DGK\u03b3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), DgMab-6, which is very useful in immunocytochemistry of human cultured cells. In this study, we characterized the binding epitope of DgMab-6 using Western blotting, and Glu12 is important for facilitating the DgMab-6 binding to the DGK\u03b3 protein. These results might lead to further development for sensitive and specific mAbs against DGK\u03b3."]}
