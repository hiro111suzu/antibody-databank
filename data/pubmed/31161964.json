Sensitive and specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for PDPN are needed for immunohistochemical analyses. Recently, we developed an anticetacean PDPN mAb, PMab-237. Herein, immunohistochemical analyses showed that PMab-237 strongly detected pulmonary type I alveolar cells, renal podocytes, and lymphatic endothelial cells of the harbor porpoise. These findings suggest that PMab-237 may be useful for immunohistochemical analyses for cetacean tissues."],"kw":[{"name":"Alveolar Epithelial Cells","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Antibody Specificity","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Endothelial Cells","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Epitopes","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"immunology"},{"name":"PDPN protein, human"},{"name":"Phocoena","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Podocytes","q":"immunology"}]}
