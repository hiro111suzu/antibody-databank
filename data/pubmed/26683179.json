PDPN is also expressed in several normal tissues, such as lung type I alveolar cells and kidney podocytes. Although many monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against human PDPN (hPDPN) or mouse PDPN (mPDPN) have been established, anti-rat PDPN (rPDPN) MAbs, especially against platelet aggregation-stimulating (PLAG) domain (29-54 amino acids) of rPDPN, have not been developed. Therefore, functional analysis of rPDPN in normal tissues has been limited. Here, we immunized mice with rPDPN peptides (38-51 amino acids) and developed a novel mouse anti-rPDPN MAb, PMab-2 (IgG1, kappa), which possesses high affinity compared with anti-hPDPN or mPDPN MAbs. The KD of PMab-2 was determined to be 5.9 \u00d7 10(-10) M. PMab-2 is useful, not only in flow cytometry and Western blot analysis against endogenous rPDPN, which is expressed in rat dermal fibroblast, but also in immunohistochemistry against normal tissues. PMab-2 showed extraordinarily high sensitivity in immunohistochemistry, indicating that PMab-2 is very advantageous for functional analysis of rPDPN."],"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"biosynthesis"},{"name":"Antibody Affinity"},{"name":"Antibody Specificity"},{"name":"CHO Cells"},{"name":"Cricetinae"},{"name":"Cricetulus"},{"name":"Female"},{"name":"Gene Expression"},{"name":"Gp38 protein, rat"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Immunization"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","q":"biosynthesis"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","q":"methods"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"analysis"},{"name":"Mice"},{"name":"Mice, Inbred BALB C"},{"name":"Peptides","q":"administration & dosage"},{"name":"Protein Binding"},{"name":"Protein Structure, Tertiary"},{"name":"Rats"},{"name":"Recombinant Proteins","q":"analysis"}]}
