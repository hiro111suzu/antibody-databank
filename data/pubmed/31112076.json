PDPN comprises three platelet aggregation-stimulating (PLAG) domains (PLAG1, PLAG2, and PLAG3) in the N-terminus and PLAG-like domains in the middle of the PDPN protein. We have previously reported on an anti-tiger PDPN (tigPDPN) monoclonal antibody (mAb), PMab-231, which was developed using the Cell-Based Immunization and Screening (CBIS) method. PMab-231 is very useful in flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analyses; however, the binding epitope of PMab-231 remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the epitopes of PMab-231, which was developed by CBIS method, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results revealed that the critical epitopes of PMab-231 are Glu29, Asp30, Asp31, Ile32, Met33, Thr34, Pro35, Gly36, and Glu38 of tigPDPN, which is corresponding to PLAG1/2. The findings of our study can be applied to the production of more functional anti-tigPDPN mAbs."]}
