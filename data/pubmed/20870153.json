Podoplanin has been reported to be a novel marker to enrich tumor-initiating cells, which are thought to resist conventional therapies and to be responsible for cancer relapse. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an anti-podoplanin antibody is suitable to target radionuclides to malignant gliomas.","METHODS":"The binding affinity of an anti-podoplanin antibody, NZ-1 (rat IgG(2a)), was determined by surface plasmon resonance and Scatchard analysis. NZ-1 was radioiodinated with (125)I using Iodogen [(125)I-NZ-1(Iodogen)] or N-succinimidyl 4-guanidinomethyl 3-[(131)I]iodobenzoate ([(131)I]SGMIB-NZ-1), and paired-label internalization assays of NZ-1 were performed. The tissue distribution of (125)I-NZ-1(Iodogen) and that of [(131)I]SGMIB-NZ-1 were then compared in athymic mice bearing glioblastoma xenografts.","RESULTS":"The dissociation constant (K(D)) of NZ-1 was determined to be 1.2 \u00d7 10(-10) M by surface plasmon resonance and 9.8 \u00d7 10(-10) M for D397MG glioblastoma cells by Scatchard analysis. Paired-label internalization assays in LN319 glioblastoma cells indicated that [(131)I]SGMIB-NZ-1 resulted in higher intracellular retention of radioactivity (26.3 \u00b1 0.8% of initially bound radioactivity at 8 h) compared to that from the (125)I-NZ-1(Iodogen) (10.0 \u00b1 0.1% of initially bound radioactivity at 8 h). Likewise, tumor uptake of [(131)I]SGMIB-NZ-1 (39.9 \u00b1 8.8 %ID/g at 24 h) in athymic mice bearing D2159MG xenografts in vivo was significantly higher than that of (125)I-NZ-1(Iodogen) (29.7 \u00b1 6.1 %ID/g at 24 h).","CONCLUSIONS":"The overall results suggest that an anti-podoplanin antibody NZ-1 warrants further evaluation for antibody-based therapy against glioblastoma.","Copyright":" 2010 Elsevier Inc.
