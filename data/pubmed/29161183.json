Nevertheless, increased expression of PDPN in malignant tumors not only associates with poor prognosis but also facilitates hematogenous metastasis through interaction with C-type lectin-like receptor-2 presented on platelets, followed by PDPN-mediated platelet activation. We previously reported a novel PMab-38 antibody, an anti-dog PDPN (dPDPN) monoclonal antibody, which specifically recognizes PDPN in squamous cell carcinomas melanomas and cancer-associated fibroblasts in canine cancer tissues. However, the specific binding with the epitope of PMab-38 remains undefined. In this study, flow cytometry was utilized to investigate the epitope of PMab-38, which was determined using a series of deletion or point mutants of dPDPN. The results revealed that the critical epitope of PMab-38 is Tyr67 and Glu68 of dPDPN."],"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"genetics"},{"name":"CHO Cells"},{"name":"Cricetulus"},{"name":"Dogs"},{"name":"Epitope Mapping"},{"name":"Epitopes","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Point Mutation"}]}
