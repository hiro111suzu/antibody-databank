We produced a rat-human chimeric anti-podoplanin mAb, NZ-8, from rat anti-podoplanin mAb (NZ-1). Although both NZ-1 and NZ-8 possess high binding affinities and high neutralizing activities of platelet aggregation, the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity of NZ-8 were much higher than NZ-1. Furthermore, both NZ-1 and NZ-8 inhibited the growth of podoplanin-expressing tumors in vivo. Both NZ-1 and NZ-8 also suppressed hematogenous metastasis of podoplanin-expressing tumors. These results suggest that anti-podoplanin mAbs suppressed hematogenous metastasis by both neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity/complement-dependent cytotoxicity activities. Targeting therapy to podoplanin-expressing tumors should be useful as a novel immunotherapy.","Copyright":" 2012 Japanese Cancer Association."},"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Antibodies, Neutralizing","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Antineoplastic Agents","q":"immunology"},{"name":"CHO Cells"},{"name":"Cell Line, Tumor"},{"name":"Complement System Proteins","id":"9007-36-7","db":"cas","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Cricetinae"},{"name":"Female"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Male"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Mice"},{"name":"Mice, Inbred BALB C"},{"name":"Mice, Nude"},{"name":"Neoplasm Metastasis"},{"name":"Neoplasms","q":"immunology"},{"name":"PDPN protein, human"},{"name":"Platelet Aggregation","q":"drug effects"},{"name":"Rats"},{"name":"Rats, Wistar"},{"name":"Recombinant Fusion Proteins","q":"immunology"}]}
