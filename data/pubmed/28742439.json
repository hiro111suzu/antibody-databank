Since both diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid serve as signaling molecules, DGK is regarded as a hub between diacylglycerol-mediated and phosphatidic acid-mediated signaling. One of the 10 DGK isozymes, DGK\u03b1, is shown to be involved in T cell function. Transfection studies using tagged expression vectors revealed that DGK\u03b1 localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus and translocates to the plasma membrane in response to T cell receptor stimulation. However, a limited number of studies reported the localization of native protein of DGK\u03b1 in tissues and cells. In this study, we immunized mice with recombinant DGK\u03b1 and developed several anti-DGK\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). One of the established anti-DGK\u03b1 mAbs is a clone DaMab-2 (mouse IgG, kappa). In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, DaMab-2 recognized only DGK\u03b1, and did not react with the other isozymes, such as DGK\u03b3, DGK\u03b6, DGK\u03b7, and DGK\u03b4. Importantly, DaMab-2 is very useful in immunocytochemical analysis of human cultured cells, indicating that DaMab-2 is advantageous to analyze the localization and function of DGK\u03b1."],"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"chemistry"},{"name":"Antibody Specificity"},{"name":"Diacylglycerol Kinase","id":"2.7.1.107","db":"ec","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Escherichia coli"},{"name":"Female"},{"name":"Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect"},{"name":"HeLa Cells"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Hybridomas"},{"name":"Mice, Inbred BALB C"}]}
