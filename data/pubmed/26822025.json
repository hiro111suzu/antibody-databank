Podoplanin (PDPN) is a type I transmembrane mucin-like glycoprotein, expressed in the lymphatic endothelium. Several solid tumors overexpress PDPN, including the mesenchymal type of GBM, which has been reported to present the worst prognosis among GBM subtypes. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-transduced T cells can recognize predefined tumor surface antigens independent of MHC restriction, which is often downregulated in gliomas. We constructed a lentiviral vector expressing a third-generation CAR comprising a PDPN-specific antibody (NZ-1-based single-chain variable fragment) with CD28, 4-1BB, and CD3\u03b6 intracellular domains. CAR-transduced peripheral blood monocytes were immunologically evaluated by calcein-mediated cytotoxic assay, ELISA, tumor size, and overall survival. The generated CAR T cells were specific and effective against PDPN-positive GBM cells in vitro. Systemic injection of the CAR T cells into an immunodeficient mouse model inhibited the growth of intracranial glioma xenografts in vivo. CAR T-cell therapy that targets PDPN would be a promising adoptive immunotherapy to treat mesenchymal GBM.","Copyright":"2016 American Association for Cancer Research."},"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Brain Neoplasms","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Cell Line, Tumor"},{"name":"Coculture Techniques"},{"name":"Female"},{"name":"Glioblastoma","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Immunotherapy, Adoptive"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Mice, Inbred NOD"},{"name":"Mice, SCID"},{"name":"Neoplasm Transplantation"},{"name":"PDPN protein, human"},{"name":"Receptors, Antigen","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Recombinant Fusion Proteins","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"T-Lymphocytes","q":"immunology"}]}
