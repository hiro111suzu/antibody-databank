The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of podoplanin in lymphangiogenesis and macrophage functions under inflammatory conditions.","METHODS":"Mouse corneal suture and ear section models were used to induce lymphangiogenesis and macrophage infiltration. Antilymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan-1 (Anti-LYVE-1) antibody was used to visualize lymphatic vessels. Thioglycollate-induced macrophages (mps) were collected and cultured with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IFN-\u03b3, and anti-mouse podoplanin antibody (PMab-1). Podoplanin, NF-\u03baB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway expression were detected by Western blot analysis. The TNF-\u03b1 secretion was measured by ELISA.","RESULTS":"Administration of PMab-1, reduced lymphangiogenesis in the corneal suture and ear wound healing models. Also, PMab-1 suppressed mps infiltration at the site of wound healing. Moreover, administration of PMab-1 led to a significant suppression of the rejection reaction in the corneal transplantation model. Our in vitro experiments showed that PMab-1 suppressed TNF-\u03b1 secretion from mps under inflamed conditions, especially secretion caused by LPS stimulation. We confirmed the effect of PMab-1 on mps under inflamed conditions with a Western blot experiment, which clearly showed that the phosphorylation signal of the MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways was suppressed by PMab-1.","CONCLUSIONS":"Podoplanin neutralization resulted in inhibition of lymphatic growth associated with corneal and ear wound healing as well as mps inflammation. These data suggest that podoplanin is a novel therapeutic target for suppressing lymphangiogenesis and inflammation.","Copyright":"2014 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc."},"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Blotting, Western"},{"name":"Cells, Cultured"},{"name":"Cornea","q":"blood supply"},{"name":"Corneal Neovascularization","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Corneal Transplantation"},{"name":"Disease Models, Animal"},{"name":"Endothelium, Lymphatic","q":"drug effects"},{"name":"Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"},{"name":"Gp38 protein, mouse"},{"name":"Lymphangiogenesis","q":"drug effects"},{"name":"Macrophages","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Male"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"antagonists & inhibitors"},{"name":"Mice"},{"name":"Mice, Inbred BALB C"},{"name":"Mice, Inbred C57BL"},{"name":"Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","id":"2.7.11.24","db":"ec","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Wound Healing","q":"drug effects"}]}
