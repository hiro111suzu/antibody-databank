The PA tag is a dodecapeptide (GVAMPGAEDDVV) that is recognized by a high-affinity antibody NZ-1. We determined the crystal structure of the PA-tag-NZ-1 complex and found that NZ-1 recognizes a central segment of the PA tag peptide in a tight \u03b2-turn configuration, suggesting that it is compatible with the insertion into a loop. This possibility was tested and confirmed using multiple integrin subunits and semaphorin. More specifically, the PA tag can be inserted at multiple locations within the integrin \u03b1IIb subunit (encoded by ITGA2B) of the fibrinogen receptor \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin (of which the \u03b23 subunit is encoded by ITGB3) without affecting the structural and functional integrity, while maintaining its high affinity for NZ-1. The large choice of the sites for 'epitope grafting' enabled the placement of the PA tag at a location whose accessibility is modulated during the biological action of the receptor. Thus, we succeeded in converting a general anti-tag antibody into a special anti-integrin antibody that can be classified as a ligand-induced binding site antibody.","Copyright":" 2016.
