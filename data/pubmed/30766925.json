However, mAbs against horse PDPN (horPDPN), which are useful for immunohistochemical analysis, remain to be developed. In the present study, mice were immunized with horPDPN-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (CHO/horPDPN), and hybridomas producing mAbs against horPDPN were screened using flow cytometry. One of the mAbs, PMab-219 (IgG, kappa), specifically detected CHO/horPDPN cells via flow cytometry and recognized horPDPN protein using Western blotting. Furthermore, PMab-219 strongly stained CHO/horPDPN via immunohistochemistry. These findings suggest that PMab-219 is useful for investigating the function of horPDPN."]}
