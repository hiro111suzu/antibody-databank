The most suitable tag for a particular purpose should be selected from many available affinity tag systems. In this study, we developed a novel affinity tag called the \"RAP tag\" system, which comprises a mouse antirat podoplanin monoclonal antibody (clone PMab-2) and the RAP tag (DMVNPGLEDRIE). This system is useful not only for protein detection in Western blotting, flow cytometry, and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, but also for protein purification."],"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"chemistry"},{"name":"Antibody Affinity"},{"name":"Antibody Specificity"},{"name":"CHO Cells"},{"name":"Cricetulus"},{"name":"ErbB Receptors","id":"2.7.10.1","db":"ec","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Gene Expression"},{"name":"Gp38 protein, rat"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Mice"},{"name":"Peptides","q":"chemistry"},{"name":"Rats"},{"name":"Staining and Labeling","q":"methods"}]}
