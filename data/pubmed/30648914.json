Both DG and PA serve as signaling molecules; therefore, DGK functions as a key enzyme between DG- and PA-mediated signaling. DGK\u03b1, one of the 10 DGK isozymes, is involved in T cell function and has been shown to localize in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, DGK\u03b1 translocates to the plasma membrane in response to T cell receptor stimulation. Recently, we developed a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), DaMab-2 (mouse IgG, kappa), against DGK\u03b1. DaMab-2 is very useful in immunocytochemical analysis using HeLa cells. In this study, we characterized the binding epitope of DaMab-2 using Western blot and revealed that Cys246, Lys249, Pro252, and Cys253 of DGK\u03b1 are important for DaMab-2 binding to the DGK\u03b1 protein. Our findings can be applied for the production of more functional anti-DGK\u03b1 mAbs."],"kw":[{"name":"Amino Acids","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Diacylglycerol Kinase","id":"2.7.1.107","db":"ec","q":"antagonists & inhibitors"},{"name":"Epitope Mapping","q":"methods"},{"name":"Epitopes","q":"chemistry"},{"name":"HeLa Cells"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Phosphatidic Acids","q":"chemistry"},{"name":"Protein Binding"},{"name":"Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Signal Transduction"},{"name":"T-Lymphocytes","q":"immunology"}]}
