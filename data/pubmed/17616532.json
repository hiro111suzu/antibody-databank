However, the mechanism by which podoplanin induces these cellular processes including its receptor has not been elucidated to date. Podoplanin induced platelet aggregation with a long lag phase, which is dependent upon Src and phospholipase Cgamma2 activation. However, it does not bind to glycoprotein VI. This mode of platelet activation was reminiscent of the snake toxin rhodocytin, the receptor of which has been identified by us as a novel platelet activation receptor, C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) (Suzuki-Inoue, K., Fuller, G. L., Garcia, A., Eble, J. A., Pohlmann, S., Inoue, O., Gartner, T. K., Hughan, S. C., Pearce, A. C., Laing, G. D., Theakston, R. D., Schweighoffer, E., Zitzmann, N., Morita, T., Tybulewicz, V. L., Ozaki, Y., and Watson, S. P. (2006) Blood 107, 542-549). Therefore, we sought to evaluate whether CLEC-2 serves as a physiological counterpart for podoplanin. Association between CLEC-2 and podoplanin was confirmed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, their association was dependent on sialic acid on O-glycans of podoplanin. Recombinant CLEC-2 inhibited platelet aggregation induced by podoplanin-expressing tumor cells or lymphatic endothelial cells, suggesting that CLEC-2 is responsible for platelet aggregation induced by endogenously expressed podoplanin on the cell surfaces. These findings suggest that CLEC-2 is a physiological target protein of podoplanin and imply that it is involved in podoplanin-induced platelet aggregation, tumor metastasis, and other cellular responses related to podoplanin."],"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"CHO Cells"},{"name":"CLEC2B protein, human"},{"name":"Cell Line, Tumor"},{"name":"Cricetinae"},{"name":"Cricetulus"},{"name":"Endothelial Cells","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Enzyme Activation","q":"drug effects"},{"name":"Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","q":"drug effects"},{"name":"Gp38 protein, mouse"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Lectins, C-Type","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Mice"},{"name":"Mice, Transgenic"},{"name":"N-Acetylneuraminic Acid","id":"GZP2782OP0","db":"uk","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Neoplasm Metastasis"},{"name":"Neoplasms","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"PDPN protein, human"},{"name":"Phospholipase C gamma","id":"3.1.4.3","db":"ec","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Platelet Aggregation","q":"drug effects"},{"name":"Polysaccharides","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Recombinant Proteins"},{"name":"Viper Venoms","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"rhodocytin protein, Calloselasma rhodostoma"},{"name":"src-Family Kinases","id":"2.7.10.2","db":"ec","q":"metabolism"}]}
