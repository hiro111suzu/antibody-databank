Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, and bovine PDPN have already been established; however, mAbs against pig PDPN (pPDPN) are lacking. In the present study, mice were immunized with pPDPN-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (CHO/pPDPN), and hybridomas producing mAbs against pPDPN were identified by flow cytometric screening. One of the mAbs, PMab-213 (IgG, kappa), could specifically detect CHO/pPDPN cells through flow cytometry and detect pPDPN through western blot analysis. K of PMab-213 for CHO/pPDPN was determined to be 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 M, indicating a high affinity for CHO/pPDPN. Furthermore, PMab-213 strongly stained lymphatic endothelial cells, renal podocytes, and type I lung alveolar cells through immunohistochemistry. PMab-213 is expected to be useful in investigating the function of pPDPN."],"kw":[{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"biosynthesis"},{"name":"CHO Cells"},{"name":"Cricetulus"},{"name":"Endothelial Cells","q":"metabolism"},{"name":"Epitope Mapping"},{"name":"Epitopes","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Flow Cytometry"},{"name":"Gp38 protein, mouse"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","q":"methods"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Mice"},{"name":"Podocytes","q":"chemistry"},{"name":"Pulmonary Alveoli","q":"cytology"},{"name":"Swine","q":"genetics"}]}
