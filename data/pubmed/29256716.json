Recently, we developed PMab-38, an anti-dog podoplanin monoclonal antibody that did not stain canine LECs. In this study, we newly developed PMab-48 against dog podoplanin. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PMab-48 reacts not only with canine squamous cell carcinoma cells but also with LECs of the normal colon. Therefore, PMab-48 may be useful in investigating the function of dog podoplanin in LECs."],"kw":[{"name":"Amino Acid Sequence"},{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"biosynthesis"},{"name":"Antibody Specificity"},{"name":"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Dogs"},{"name":"Endothelial Cells","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Female"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Hybridomas"},{"name":"Membrane Glycoproteins","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Mice"},{"name":"Mice, Inbred BALB C"},{"name":"PDPN protein, human"},{"name":"Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}
