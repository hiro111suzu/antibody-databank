In this study, we established novel anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and characterized their efficacy in flow cytometry, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses. We immunized mice with a combination of the extracellular domain of EGFR and EGFR-overexpressing LN229 glioblastoma cells (LN229/EGFR) and performed the first screening using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Next, we selected mAbs using flow cytometry. Among 156 established clones, two mAbs, EMab-51 (IgG, kappa) and EMab-134 (IgG, kappa), reacted with EGFR in Western blot analysis; EMab-134 showed a much higher sensitivity compared with EMab-51. We compared the binding affinities of EMab-51 and EMab-134 using flow cytometry; the calculated K values for EMab-51 and EMab-134 against SAS cells/HSC-2 cells were 9.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 M/9.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910 M and 2.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910 M/8.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910 M, respectively, indicating that EMab-134 has a higher affinity to EGFR-expressing cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of EMab-51 and EMab-134 showed sensitive and specific reactions against oral cancer cells; EMab-134 demonstrated a much higher sensitivity (36/38 cases; 94.7%) to oral squamous cell carcinomas compared with EMab-51 (6/38 cases; 15.8%). This novel anti-EGFR mAb, EMab-134, could be advantageous for detecting EGFR in the pathological analysis of EGFR-expressing cancers."],"kw":[{"name":"Aged"},{"name":"Animals"},{"name":"Antibodies, Monoclonal","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Antibody Specificity"},{"name":"CHO Cells"},{"name":"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Cell Line, Tumor"},{"name":"Cricetulus"},{"name":"EGFR protein, human","id":"2.7.10.1","db":"ec"},{"name":"ErbB Receptors","id":"2.7.10.1","db":"ec","q":"genetics"},{"name":"Female"},{"name":"Humans"},{"name":"Hybridomas"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","q":"methods"},{"name":"Male"},{"name":"Mice, Inbred BALB C"},{"name":"Middle Aged"},{"name":"Mouth Neoplasms","q":"immunology"},{"name":"Recombinant Proteins","q":"genetics"}]}
