Podoplanin expression in cancer cells or cancer-associated fibroblasts was reported to be involved in poor prognosis of several cancers. Furthermore, podoplanin is expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells or lung type I alveolar cells. Although many anti-podoplanin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), such as NZ-1 and D2-40, have been established, almost all anti-podoplanin MAbs are produced against a platelet aggregation-inducing (PLAG) domain. In this study, we produced and characterized a novel anti-podoplanin monoclonal antibody, LpMab-3, the epitope of which is a sialylated glycopeptide of podoplanin. We identified the minimum epitope of LpMab-3 as Thr76-Glu81 of human podoplanin, which is different from PLAG domain, using Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that LpMab-3 is useful for detecting lung type I alveolar cells and lymphatic endothelial cells. Because LpMab-3 detects only sialylated podoplanin, it could be useful for uncovering the physiological function of sialylated human podoplanin.
